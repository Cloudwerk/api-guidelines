### About guidelines

In the scope of a company, organization or team, the document known as guidelines is a set of best practices or hints provided by a group of subject matter experts in that particular technology. The most important aspects of it:

- Help to create a standardized way of completing specific tasks, making outcome more predictable and alike
- Help to identify do's and dont's with regards to a specific technology or tool
- Help to avoid gotchas or problems related with company specifics
- Gather the knowledge of several Subject Matter Experts and prevent others for falling in frequent caveats or mistakes

**Note** In any case, the content in the guidelines should be taken as recommendations, not something that needs to be done in a mandatory way.
