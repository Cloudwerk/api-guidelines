# AsyncAPI Version

Any version of AsyncAPI **MAY** be used for spec definitions.

However, to be aligned with adidas tooling, spec versions **SHOULD** be _v2.6.0_, because to the date of this document creation (April 2024) this is the highest supported version on Swaggerhub, the current API portal to render, discover and publish specs.

```yaml
asyncapi: '2.6.0'
...
```
