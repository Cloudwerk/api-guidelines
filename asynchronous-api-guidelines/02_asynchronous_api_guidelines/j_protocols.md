## Asynchronous API guidelines

### Protocols

Protocols define how clients and servers communicate in an asynchronous architecture.

The accepted protocols for asynchronous APIs are:

- Kafka
- HTTPs
- WebSockets
- MQTT

This version of the guidelines focuses on Kafka protocol, but it could be extended in the future. In any case, this document will be updated to reflect the state of the art.
