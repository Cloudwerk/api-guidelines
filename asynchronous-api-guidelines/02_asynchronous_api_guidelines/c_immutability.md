## Asynchronous API guidelines

### Immutability

After agreement with the stakeholders the contract **MUST** be published in order to do it immutable. Changes to the API related to the data model, **MUST** be published in a schema registry. 

Schema registry acts as a central location for storing and accessing the schemas of all published APIs.
