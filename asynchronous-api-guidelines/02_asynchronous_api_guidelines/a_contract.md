## Asynchronous API guidelines

### Contract

The definition of an asynchronous API **MUST** represent a contract between API owners and the stakeholders. 

That contract **MUST** contain enough information to use the API (servers, URIs, credentials, contact information, etc) and to identify which kind of information is being exchanged there.
