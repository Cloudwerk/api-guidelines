# Events as Notifications

When a system uses events as notifications it becomes a plugged system. The producers have no knowledge about the consumers and they don't really care about them, instead every consumer can decide if it is interested in the information included in the event.

This way, the number of consumers can be increased (or reduced) without changing anything on the producer side.

This pluggability becomes increasily important as systems get more complex.
